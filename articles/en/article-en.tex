\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

%Software systems are usually designed with a specific purpose in mind. They rely on a series of requirements which are often very difficult to capture and maintain, as they have a tendency to evolve faster than the implementation. This is caused mainly by the poor understanding by the stakeholders about their needs and expectations about what a software system should be able to do~\cite{PT07}. These situations lead to higher costs in software development, as creating and maintaining software systems is a knowledge intensive task~\cite{AdOdSBD07}. Moreover, most of these system are not static, and have a constant need to evolve in order to adapt themselves to their environment and new business rules, shifting the stakeholders' needs and expectations about these software systems.

%In face of these situations, new development methods started to focus more on iterative and incremental approaches, accepting \emph{incompleteness} as part of every software system's development cycle~\cite{WC03}. At the same time, many new systems are being developed with an emphasis on flexibility and run-time configuration~\cite{YJ02}.

\section{Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}

An Adaptive Object-Model (AOM) is an architectural style based on metamodeling and object-oriented design that exposes its domain model to the end-user, and aims to create better mechanisms for the evolution and adaptation of software systems to their environments.

The first chalenge is to adapt some of the ideologies and techniques of the AOM architectural style to a Ruby on Rails application (using an MVC architecture), using an application design based on a static schema from a relational database (MySQL), by applying a series of design patterns connected with AOM architectures. Three areas within the \emph{escolinhas.pt} platform were chosen to perform this refactoring: User Roles, Social Network and Document Editor.

The second goal is to measure how the variability and performance of each component are affected by the application of these design patterns.

\section{User Roles}\label{sec:user_roles}

In \emph{escolinhas.pt}, user roles are organized as an \textsc{Organization Hierarchy}~\cite{fowler_accountability}. This creates some problems when trying to create new roles or give special privileges to an user, due to multi-level hierarchy used.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/user_roles_current}}
  \caption{Current User Roles Model.}
  \label{fig:user_roles_current}
\end{figure}

By using the \textsc{Role Object} pattern, the roles are split into single classes, which allows capturing the key abstractions of each one individually. By flattening the hierarchy, it is now possible to develop roles individually, as well as have users associated with multiple roles without fear of rule clashing.

  \centering{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/user_roles_conceptual}}
  \caption{Conceptual User Roles Model.}
  \label{fig:user_roles_conceptual}
\end{figure}

\section{Social Network}\label{sec:social_network}

The current design for the \emph{escolinhas.pt} social network is based on the relationships formed through the connections between users and their schools, groups, and other users, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:social_network_current}. This allows the construction of a network where all the connections can be inferred dynamically and where an user can be identified towards another through these same connections. This model, however useful, offers a very small degree of variability.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering{\includegraphics[width=35mm]{figures/social_network_current}}
  \caption{Current User Network Model.}
  \label{fig:social_network_current}
\end{figure}

The usage of the \textsc{Accountability} design pattern, by Martin Fowler~\cite{fowler_accountability} allows the creation of a relationship between two different entities in the system, with a third optional entity providing more information as to how they are connected.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/social_network_conceptual}}
  \caption{Conceptual User Network Model.}
  \label{fig:social_network_conceptual}
\end{figure}

\section{Document Editor}\label{sec:document_editor}

The existing document editor in \emph{escolinhas.pt} is one of the core components of the system and one of the used features. This being the case, and due to the constantly evolving nature of the product and the product itself, it is also one of the most modified parts of the system. The document editor infrastructure has to grow both in size and complexity every time a new type of block content is introduced --- represented by the gray entities in Fig.~\ref{fig:documents_current} --- by creating new Models, Controller, Views and duplicating all the logic from existing Block types.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/documents_current}}
  \caption{Current Documents Model.}
  \label{fig:documents_current}
\end{figure}

The solution devised for the \emph{Documents} infrastructure is, the simplest structure possible that makes everything work (as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:documents_conceptual}). This is made possible by using a variant of the \textsc{Property} pattern~\cite{metadata_and_active_object_models} and the \textsc{System Memento}~\cite{patterns_data_and_metadata_evolution_in_aoms}

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Despite being built with an MVC architecture, the Ruby On Rails framework is, using the right approach, capable of working with some architectural and design patterns --- present in AOM architectures --- not obviously connected with MVC and AR. The application of these patterns is capable of increasing the level of variability present in a common Rails application, and a harmonious integration with the Rails 2.3.x infrastructure --- especially the \textsc{ActiveRecord} engine --- is possible and works elegantly.

It is also possible to conclude that the application of the appropriate design patterns is able to increase not only the variability and configurability needs of a specific part of an application, but also its performance, in some cases. However, this should not be taken as an universal truth, as it depends on a series of factors that may not be present in all implementations, such as a previous innapropriate design.
