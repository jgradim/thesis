C\# (C-Sharp) is a multi-paradigm, strongly-typed programming language developed by Microsoft within the .NET framework. C\# is an object-oriented language, but includes support for other programming paradigms such as functional, imperative, and component-oriented. It was built to be a robust and performant language, featuring strong type-checking, array bounds checking, detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection~\cite{csharp}.
