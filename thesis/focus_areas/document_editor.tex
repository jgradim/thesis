\section{Documents}\label{sec:fa_documents}

The last studied area --- the Document Editor --- is also the most used and most complex component of the system. It is the main means of collaboration between students and teachers, and used to create essays, using a series of different digital contents, such as images, videos, or maps. As one of the most used features of the system, it is also the one most subject to modification. This section details the work performed in order to make the process of modifying the Document Editor as agile as possible.

\subsection{Variability Requirements}\label{sec:fa_documents_variability_requirements}

The document editor present in \emph{escolinhas.pt} is one of the core components of the system and one of the most used features of the platform. This being the case, and due to the constantly evolving nature of the product and the product itself, it is also one of the most modified parts of the system. As it can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:documents_current}, this structure has to grow both in size and complexity every time a new type of \emph{Block} content is introduced --- represented by the gray entities in Fig.~\ref{fig:documents_current}. This means that whenever a new type of content is introduced in the system, which happens somewhat frequently --- from three types of \emph{Blocks} (\emph{Paragraphs}, \emph{Drawings} and \emph{ImageDocuments/Photos}) in September 2009 to seven in April/May 2010 --- it is necessary to setup a new \textsc{ActiveRecord} class (along with all the logic for versioning) and a new \textsc{Controller} (MVC) to accept the requests necessary to create, edit or delete any of these entities. Despite working as intended, this workflow is not adequate to the constant evolution and prototyping the document editor is subjected to.

\subsection{Candidate Patterns}\label{sec:fa_documents_candidate_patterns}

% \emph{Block} types
One of the major causes of slow and irksome development of new types of \emph{Blocks}, is, as stated in the previous section, the sheer amount of code duplication involved. This involves painstakingly copying the Model, the Controller and all the Views from a previous existing \emph{Block} type, and then modifying the required parts. This approach is brittle and extremely prone to errors. However, if a more general and abstract analysis is performed, a \emph{Block} type is nothing more than a very complex variable. As such, the problem can now be approached to as finding the best way to create new types of variables, on demand, and with as little work involved as possible --- and the current research on AOM architectures has already solved this problem, by means of the \textsc{Type-Object} and \textsc{Property} (and, consequently, the \textsc{Type-Square}, described in \ref{sec:type-object_pattern}, \ref{sec:property_pattern} and \ref{sec:type-square_pattern}, respectively) patterns.

% versioning
The research on versioning and maintaining a temporal history for objects is extensive. In~\cite{patterns_data_and_metadata_evolution_in_aoms}, Hugo Ferreira \textit{et al.} describe the most appropriate patterns pertaining to data and metadatada evolution within the context of AOM architectures. The most important one is \textsc{System Memento}, as described in \ref{sec:system_memento_pattern}. Martin Fowler has also compiled a collection of patterns that aim to deal with temporal changes to an object or system state, in~\cite{fowler_pattern_for_things_that_change_with_time}. Two of the most promising patterns described are the \textsc{Temporal Object}~\cite{fowler_temporal_object} and \textsc{Snapshot}~\cite{fowler_snapshot}. However, neither one of the aforementioned patterns is completely adequate to solve the problem at hand. On one hand, \textsc{Temporal Object} assumes the creation of a dedicated entity just to be able to access a certain object at a given point in time --- as one of the objectives of the refactoring of this hotspot is to reduce the associated codebase and work necessary to create new types of \emph{Blocks}, the usage of this pattern must be discarded. On the other hand, the usage of \textsc{Snapshot} assumes that the Snaphot itself is to be used as an adapter on the underlying object, which once again assumes the usage of a separate object to handle recording the state of any given entity in a particular point in time.

% validations
One important part of the document editor is the validation of user input. As it is the only focus area which deals directly with free-form user input, the validation of the values need to be taken into account. The \textsc{Strategy} and \textsc{Interpreter} pattern (described in \ref{sec:strategy_pattern} and \ref{sec:interpreter_pattern}, respectively), are two patterns that would be adequate to write and perform all of the validations required by the \emph{Block} \texttt{item} logic. However, these two patterns are mainly directed to when a system needs to have end-user level variability. In this particular case, the definition and creation of new types of \emph{Blocks} is a task for the development team. As such, the usage of these patterns is unnecessary as far as validations are regarded. In order to simplify development and validations themselves, Ruby will act as both the \emph{language} and \emph{execution} engine for the validations. This is done by using a custom, extensible DSL built atop of the language itself; thus, the \textsc{Strategy} and \textsc{Interpreter} pattern are effectively ``absorbed'' by the host language (Ruby) atop of which the platform is built.

\subsection{Chosen Patterns \& Rationale}\label{sec:fa_documents_chosen_patterns_rationale}

The solution devised for the \emph{Documents} infrastructure is, as required by all the necessities stated in \ref{sec:fa_documents_variability_requirements} and \ref{sec:fa_documents_candidate_patterns}, the simplest structure possible --- as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:documents_conceptual} --- that makes everything work as before and makes the data transition tasks as simple and seamless as possible. This is due to the metaprogramming facilities of the Ruby language and the excellent support present in the serialization and \textsc{ActiveRecord} tools provided by RoR.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=65mm]{documents_conceptual.pdf}
  \caption{Conceptual Documents Model.}
  \label{fig:documents_conceptual}
\end{figure}

The pattern used is a \emph{composite} design pattern as described in~\cite{riehle_composite_patterns}, where various smaller design patterns work in tandem to create a more complex pattern:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textsc{System Memento} - used for versioning and handling \emph{Publications} as special states
  \item \textsc{Property} (simplified variant) - used for decoupling a \emph{Block} \texttt{item} from the database schema
\end{itemize}

The variant of the \textsc{Property} pattern implemented is simplified due to the highly dynamic nature of the Ruby language --- which means that, for this particular problem, it is able to build new types of objects or even create new class definitions in runtime, which allows discarding the \textsc{Property}--\textsc{PropertyType} pair (see \ref{sec:property_pattern}) in favour of a single entity, \texttt{item}, as shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:documents_conceptual}.

\subsection{Implementation}\label{sec:fa_documents_implementation}

The implementation of this composite pattern takes advantage of the highly dynamic nature of the Ruby language and the API provided by the \textsc{ActiveRecord} implementation of Rails.

\subsubsection{Basic Structure}\label{sec:fa_documents_implementation_basic_structure}

\emph{Document}, \emph{Block}, \emph{Version} and \emph{Publication} are all AR objects, which means that, according to the AR pattern and the Rails framework conventions, each one of them is stored inside an SQL table, with a column for each one of the attributes. This structure provides the basic blueprint (as stated in \ref{sec:case-study_areas_document_editor}) for the documents to be produced by the editor --- it allows a title, an arbitrary number of orderable \emph{Blocks}, and a snapshot (version) of each modification. It also allows for publications, which essentially point to a specific version of a document.

There is nothing really remarkable about \emph{Blocks}, \emph{Documents} of even \emph{Publications} --- they are ordinary \textsc{ActiveRecord} objects, with associations to each other (as pictured in Fig.~\ref{fig:documents_conceptual}), and explaining how they work is outside of the scope of this study.

\subsubsection{Versioning \& Block Items}\label{sec:fa_documents_implementation_versioning_and_block_items}

However, a \emph{Version} is a bit more complex than a simple AR object, in the sense that it contains a full representation of another AR object at a given point in time --- in this case, a \emph{Document}. This is achieved by serializing a \emph{Document} and all its associations (\emph{Blocks}) in the JSON format, which preserves all the necessary information needed to rebuild a specific \emph{Document} at whichever time that \emph{Version} refers to --- which means that a \emph{Version} effectively implements the \textsc{Memento} design pattern to keep a history of each \emph{Document}.

Finally, a \emph{Block} \texttt{item} possesses special properties that, together with AR, create a dynamic and variable foundation for the development of different types of content. As a \emph{Block} is simply a generic container for an arbitrary type of item, a \emph{Block} \texttt{item} can't be constrained to a single class or object type. The solution is to serialize the content inside the \emph{content} attribute of a \emph{Block}. This way, a \emph{Block} \texttt{item} is simply a string that represents a serialized object --- which can be de-serialized, accessed and modified at runtime. This means that, whichever a \emph{Block} \texttt{item} may be, the \texttt{item} itself is responsible for its representation and life cycle.

\subsubsection{Validation and Defaulting Mechanisms for Block Items}\label{sec:fa_documents_implementation_validation_and_defaulting_mechanisms_for_block_items}

In order to further simplify and streamline the development, a \emph{DocumentItem} (super)class was created. This class serves as a basis for further specialization through inheritance, and handles cross-cutting concerns such as object initialization, default values and validations for each of these attribute's values. The need for a specific controller for each one of the different \emph{Block} \texttt{items} has also been discarded in favour of a single Controller (MVC), responsible for handling the user input regarding the modification of \emph{Blocks} and their \texttt{item} contents.

The Document Editor prototype is the one that takes most advantage of the Ruby language, by extensively using metaprogramming techniques, along with JSON~\cite{rfc4627} serialization and parsing.

The defaulting and validation mechanisms implemented for the \emph{DocumentItem} class make use of the metaprogramming capabilities of the Ruby language to easily create \emph{class-level instance variables}~\cite{class_level_instance_variables} that can be shared across all the instances of each subclass of \emph{DocumentItem}.

\subsubsection{JSON Serialization}\label{sec:fa_documents_implementation_json_serialization}

JSON is exclusively used for serialization, and its usage objectives are two-fold: allowing serialization and de-serialization of any Ruby object, and the ability to use a serialized object directly in Javascript, without any need for a server-side transformation. JSON usage also allows for a more robust de-serialization of objects: as a JSON object is just a hash of key-value pairs, objects are built from a class method, \emph{DocumentItem.from\_json}, which takes a JSON-serialized object represented as a native Ruby hash, and creates an object of the appropriate class. The difference of this approach from other serialization methods\footnote{Marshalling, YAML, etc.} is that the constructor of the class to be built is called manually\footnote{Marshalling and YAML mechanisms do not call the serialized object's constructor, only rebuild it}, which is vital to deal with system evolution. If at any point during the development the definition of a \emph{DocumentItem} specialization is modified (i.e. a new attribute is added to the class definition), the previous objects stored will not have these new attributes. The defaulting mechanism implemented solves this problem by merging the existing default values with the ones passed to the class constructor, thereby creating a valid object, regardless of the information stored in the serialized object.

\subsection{Impact Analysis}\label{sec:fa_documents_impact_analysis}

The refactoring of the Document Editor infrastructure had two major points of impact: performance, and variability.

% performance

With the current foundation for the editor, the number of queries grows linearly with the number of \emph{Blocks} that constitute a document, as it is necessary to perform a query for each one the items related to each one of the \emph{Blocks}. The usage of eager loading is limited due to the polymorphic nature of the \emph{Blocks} and each respective content, which is unknown \emph{a priori}.

From an universe of 4000 documents used in the study, the graph present in Fig.~\ref{fig:queries_per_blocks_in_document} shows a linear growth in the number of queries necessary to render a Document: the number of queries necessary are directly proportional to the number of \emph{Blocks} in a document with a 1:1 ratio. Just like in \ref{sec:fa_social_network_impact_analysis}, this represents a serious performance issue: as the most used feature in the \emph{escolinhas.pt} platform, a sustainable growth is very difficult to achieve if the database load increases linearly with the number of existent \emph{Blocks} in Documents.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=150mm]{graphs/document_queries}
  \caption{Average number of queries performed per number of \emph{Blocks} in a single Document.}
  \label{fig:queries_per_blocks_in_document}
\end{figure}

The introduction of the model described in \ref{sec:fa_documents_chosen_patterns_rationale} makes the number of queries necessary to display a \emph{Document} to be constant (only 2 queries are performed), as only the \emph{Blocks} and the Document itself are AR objects --- as the item that constitutes a \emph{Block} is an integral part of a \emph{Block}, no queries are necessary to fetch it.

% variability

Using the aforementioned infrastructure for the document editor, the work necessary to create new types of \emph{Blocks} has been greatly reduced. This allows for much shorter prototyping and testing iteration times --- no database schemas or migrations to worry about, allowing the developers to focus on the details of the model rather than implementation details --- which ultimately leads to a higher degree of variability.
