A flat Role hierarchy would allow for a more flexible authorization scheme, where a User could have one or more roles associated, depending on what actions he would be allowed to do, as shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:user_roles_conceptual}. This also makes the task of creating new roles with different authorization schemes much easier, as there is not a need to conform to any special hierarchy scheme: a new role simply means a new type of user. This clearly constrasts with the previous role's logic, where a multi-level hierarchy was in place.
