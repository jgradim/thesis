\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chap:conclusions}

The research developed for this initial stage provides a solid knowledge base, presenting an overview of existing methods and technologies.

The technologies chosen should not prove an obstacle to the development, as most of them are open-source, with good, helpful documentation and have a strong, active community.

Adaptive Object-Model architectures provide the best framework for building adaptable systems that are passable of modification by the end-users (which assumes no compilation or deployment processes). A lot of thought and research has gone into the best practices for the complete implementation of these types of systems, from model creation, maintenance and persistence to GUI generation.

There has been very few work regarding true adaptive systems on the web. However, a considerable amount of research has been made regarding the best mechanisms for end-user website customization, which can be used to create web applications based on AOM architectures. 

Finally, it is possible to conclude the objectives relative to the problem study, state of the art and technology analysis are fully completed, as well as the planning relative to the project development and dissertation writing.
