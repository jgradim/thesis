\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chap:conclusions}

\textbf{NOTE: these are only very preliminar notes on conclusions}

Despite being built with a MVC architecture, the Ruby On Rails framework is, using the right approach, capable of working with some architectural and design patterns not obviously connected with MVC and AR.

%Adaptive Object-Model architectures provide the best framework for building adaptable systems that are passable of modification by the end-users (which assumes no compilation or deployment processes). A lot of thought and research has gone into the best practices for the complete implementation of these types of systems, from model creation, maintenance and persistence to GUI generation.

%There has been very few work regarding true adaptive systems on the web. However, a considerable amount of research has been made regarding the best mechanisms for end-user website customization, which can be used to create web applications based on AOM architectures.
