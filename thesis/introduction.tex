\section{Context}\label{sec:context}

Software systems are usually designed with a specific purpose in mind. They rely on a series of requirements which are often very difficult to capture and maintain, as they have a tendency to evolve faster than the implementation. This is caused mainly by the poor understanding by the stakeholders about their needs and expectations about what a software system should be able to do~\cite{PT07}. These situations lead to higher costs in software development, as creating and maintaining software systems is a knowledge intensive task~\cite{AdOdSBD07}. Moreover, most of these system are not static, and have a constant need to evolve in order to adapt themselves to their environment and new business rules, shifting the stakeholders' needs and expectations about these software systems.

In face of these situations, new development methods started to focus more on iterative and incremental approaches, accepting \textit{incompleteness} as part of every software system development cycle~\cite{WC03}. At the same time, many new systems are being developed with an emphasizis on flexibility and run-time configuration~\cite{YJ02}. These approaches present a clear contrast with an up-front, full specification for a software system, which, albeit benefitial for some cases, are impratical in constant evolution scenarios. This leads to a change in software requirements and inevitable refactoring, which in turn may lead to a \textsc{big ball of mud}, ultimately leading to unmaintainable systems, very costly to modify and adapt to the stakeholders needs~\cite{FY97}.

\section{Motivation and Objectives}\label{sec:goals}

Developing quality software is a costly process. Maintaining, as well as adding new features to these software systems is a costly and time-consuming process. If the end-user is allowed to make changes to an information system in runtime, it can effectively shape the system's architecture (model and relation-wise) to suit his or her needs according to the natural evolution of the business rules, enviroment changes and needs.

This project will be applied to the \textit{Escolinhas}~\cite{escolinhas}, a growing, Portuguese, Ruby On Rails based project. Escolinhas aims at sustaining social and collaborative work for children in elementary schools involving students, teachers and parents as its users. With the teachers demanding better and more adaptable teaching tools, it becomes an excellent case-study application to research, test and apply all the work and discoveries made during the course of this thesis.

% Establish a reference framework using the concepts of web 2.0 for AOM systems
% Understand GUI patterns that allow end-users to manipulate domain models
% Validate through an industrial use-case application

\section{Report Overview}\label{sec:structure}

The rest of this report is structured as follows:\\

%\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:technologies}: ``\nameref{chap:technologies}'' } presents the main technologies which will be part of the development process.\\

\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:sota}: ``\nameref{chap:sota}'' } reviews the most important methodologies and patterns used to make software as adaptable and maintable as possible.\\

\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:problem_statement}: ``\nameref{chap:problem_statement}'' } exposes the problem to be addressed and thoroughly explains it, while explaining it usefulness.\\

\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:approach_results}: ``\nameref{chap:approach_results}'' } reviews the current design of the platform, and performs a variability analysis of the system, choosing three focus areas. Then, for each one of the areas, demonstrates its variability requirements, candidate patterns, the chosen patterns and rationale behind such decisions, implementation details and impact analysis.\\

\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:validation}: ``\nameref{chap:validation}'' } validates the work described in Chapter~\ref{chap:approach_results} through various metrics\\ % FIXME

\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:conclusions}: ``\nameref{chap:conclusions}'' } reviews the project, drawing conclusions about the issues addressed in Chapters \ref{chap:approach_results} and \ref{chap:validation}. It also provides a summary of contributions and some insights on which future developments have been considered.
